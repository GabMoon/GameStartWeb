## Project Description

GameStartWeb is the front end portion of a web application that provides users with a platform to search and review a list of games.

## Getting Started
* NOTE: You will need to have the other part of this project already set up in order to hit the endpoints. Here is a link to the Java portion of this project with its own README file setup: https://github.com/GabMoon/GameStart   
1. git clone https://github.com/GabMoon/GameStartWeb.git
2. Once you open the project, you will need to change the URL in each JavaScript file. These link to where ever you are running the Java backend of this project, whether it is localhost, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, or some other place. Only change up to the .com part. All parts after that are paths to specific endpoints in the Java backend.
3. You will need Node.js if you plan on running this locally because the POST requests require a server for it to run successfully. Once you have installed Node.js, run npx http-server -c-1 in the terminal or npx http-server.
4. Go to localhost:8080 or where ever the terminal tells you the front end is running.
(include all environment setup steps)

> Be sure to include BOTH Windows and Unix command  
> Be sure to mention if the commands only work on a specific platform (eg. AWS, GCP)
